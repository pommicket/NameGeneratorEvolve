# NameGeneratorEvolve
Creates names, asks you to rate them, and slowly learns which names are good.

NameGeneratorEvolve uses [StringLearn](https://github.com/pommicket/StringLearn) look at the n-grams you like, to determine which names you like.

Executables can be found in the build directory, but if you want to compile the source code, just run `make` in the src directory.

**The names evolve *very* slowly. They start out completely random.**

**Windows**  
Just run NameGeneratorEvolve.exe

**GNU/Linux**
```bash
./NameGeneratorEvolve
```

Mac OS X is not supported.
